# First NestJS Project

This is a simple backend API built with NestJS. It includes two basic routes:

1. **GET /** - Returns a welcome message.
2. **POST /data** - Accepts a JSON payload and responds with the received data.

### How to Run
- Install dependencies with `npm install`.
- Start the server with `npm run start`.

The API runs on `http://localhost:3000` by default.
